# Tic-Tac-Toe Python Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. It includes three main files:

- `cli.py`: This file provides the Command Line Interface (CLI) for playing the game. It handles input and output interactions with the user.

- `logic.py`: The core game logic resides in this file. It contains functions for managing the game's rules and state. It is designed to be unit-testable.

- `tests.py`: This file contains unit tests for the functions in `logic.py`. These tests ensure that the game logic functions as expected.

## Usage

To play the Tic-Tac-Toe game, you can run the `cli.py` file. It will guide you through the gameplay, taking turns and displaying the current state of the board.

## Files

### `cli.py`

This file contains the Command Line Interface (CLI) for the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It is responsible for handling input and output interactions with the user.

### `logic.py`

The game's core logic resides in this file. It contains functions for managing the game's rules and state. This file is designed to be unit-testable and does not handle input or output.

### `tests.py`

This file contains unit tests for the functions in `logic.py`. The tests ensure that the game logic functions correctly.

## Testing

You can run the unit tests in `tests.py` to ensure that the game logic functions correctly.

## Contributing
